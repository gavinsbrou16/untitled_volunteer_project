User Stories

@gavinsbrou16
Things to note
No matter how many user stories we have, they can ultimately be compressed into 10 major stories. For now this should serve as a means for everyone to mention how they envision the application to function. The more user stories the better!(for right now))

Think of the user/actor as the person using the application.
User
organization(type of actor)
Think of actions as functions within different classes  
Sign up
View
post
Nouns are usually classes or variables 
Profiles
Volunteer hours

EXAMPLES

1. The user will be able to view available volunteer opportunities 
2. The user will be able to ‘RSVP’ or ‘sign up’ for volunteer opportunities 
3. Approved organizations will be able to post volunteer opportunities
4. Users will be able to track volunteer hours
5. Users will be able to view other Users/Organizations profile
6.Users will have profiles containing various variables such as total hours logged etc
